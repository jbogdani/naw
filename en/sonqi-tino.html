                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                  In 1967, within the framework of the already-mentioned programme promoted by UNESCO for the exploration and rescue
                  of the archaeological heritage in the desert region of the Batn el-Hajar (“belly of the stones”), Sapienza University
                  started working at a Christian site that had been identified as 21-D-5. Sonqi West during the 1963-1964 reconnaissance
                  survey conducted by UNESCO – Sudan Antiquities Service Located on the west bank of the Nile, about 150 km south of Wadi Halfa,
                  almost at the southern border of the second cataract, the site had been briefly recorded as including a small mudbrick
                  church with possibly well-preserved paintings that were partially visible under the sand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a preliminary survey conducted by Sergio Donadoni and Sergio Bosticco in 1966, in march 1967 Sapienza obtained from the
                  Sudanese Antiquities Service, directed by Sayed Thabit Hassan Thabit, the license to excavate, record, and document the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first <em>Missione Archeologica Italiana in Sudan</em> was then launched, and the new enterprise also benefited from the important
                  support of the Italian <em>Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche</em> (C.N.R.) and that of the Vatican State. The mission, directed by Sergio Donadoni,
                  was composed of an interdisciplinary team of high profile, including: Sergio Bosticco, Ida Baldassarre, and Giovanni Uggeri (archaeologists);
                  Giuseppe Fanfoni and Italo Montalto (architects); Leonetto Tintori and Silvestro Castellani (restorers). To this group, the scholar and
                  Nubian specialist P. Giovanni Vantini was added to represent the Holy See. Finally, an interesting note concerns the employ of a
                  group of the well-known Qufti workmen (the descendents of the Egyptian excavators from the village of Quft, who had been originally
                  trained by Flinders Petrie), whose expertise was explicitly required.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a first act, it was decided to change the name of the site into its Nubian form – Sonqi Tino –, a conventional designation that
                  since then has been acquired in literature. Contrary to the initial expectations expressed in the report of the UNESCO that the
                  investigation of Sonqi West would have required a few days or weeks for cleaning the church and removing the paintings,
                  the archaeological activities carried on by <em>Sapienza</em> took four consecutive missions (1967-1970). Though short,
                  these missions were extremely intense, not just because of the painstaking fieldwork and delicate activities
                  related to the preservation of the church paintings, but also due to the remote and hardly accessible location
                  of the place, which required scrupulous arrangements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first campaign took place from 14 to 31 March 1967 and focused on clearing and exposing the basic layout of the church
                  as well as on preparing a first stage in the recovery of the paintings. The surrounding region was also explored, and the so-called <em>Diff</em>
                  (“Castle”) nearby was cleared and mapped (Panel 6). The task of preserving the painting was also the major goal of the second
                  season (21 February – 21 March 1968), together with the study of the architecture of the church. The two following campaigns
                  (15 March – 3 April 1969; 3-20 March 1970) were dedicated to completing the excavation and the historical-architectural study
                  of the church, and to the exploration of close structures, in particular of the adjoining cemetery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Closing the final season in 1970, Donadoni resumed the results and expectations of Sapienza’s mission as follows:
                </p>
                <blockquote>What we considered our main task has seemingly been fulfilled: our Mission detected and secured the paintings
                  in the first two seasons; it discovered and studied the architecture in the two following ones. We believe we are now ready
                  to publish our study on this important monument<br> (Report 1970).</blockquote>

                <h3 class="panel__title">Not Only the Church: Sonqi Tino and Its Surroundings</h3>
                <p>
                  At the moment of the discovery, the church building, placed on a sand plateau close and high above the Nile, was almost entirely
                  filled with drift sand up to the roof level. It was soon recognised as the most important monument in the area, and
                  became the focus of Sapienza’s activities, being carefully excavated, mapped, and documented in the following seasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The church consisted of a mudbrick square building (9,30 x 8,30 m), which was subsequently enlarged with the addition
                  of later structures. Its plan included nine rooms arranged according to a well-known cruciform pattern that had its fulcrum
                  in a central room (5), open on its four sides and covered by a dome, while all the others were roofed with barrel vaults.
                  The liturgical value of this layout was also materially emphasised by the fact that the chambers composing the two arms of the cross,
                  which roughly followed an east-west and north-south axis, were paved in stone. The room at the eastern end (2) was the <em>haikal</em>,
                  where a mudbrick altar was found still in place; scratched on its plastered surface, the excavators identified the name ΜΙΧΑΗΛ (Michael),
                  to whom – they suggested – the church was probably dedicated. A remarkable feature was also the discovery of a pottery censer and two
                  foundation stones, which had been deposited inside the altar. The following central room (5) formed, together with the one at the
                  opposite western end (8) the nave of the church, while the two vestibules opening on its northern (6) and southern (4) sides served
                  as the entrances to the building, looking respectively toward the desert and toward the river.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The four remaining rooms completing the plan had service functions and were thus not marked by a stone-lined pavement.
                  On the east side, the <em>haikal</em> was flanked by, and communicated with, two chambers that were identified as the <em>prothesis</em> to the north (1),
                  and the <em>diakonikon</em> (3) to the south; on the west side, room 7 was the only one found with the vault still intact, while room 9 contained
                  a staircase that originally would have given access to the terrace upstairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To this core complex was added, on the west side and in a later phase of the church, a group of elongated structures,
                  including a <em>xenodocheion</em> for accommodating visitors and pilgrims (A-D). The progress of the excavations also highlighted a
                  number of restorations and repairs (mostly due to the instability of the ground and the lack of solid foundations) of great
                  importance for understanding the architectural history of the building – a history that, as Donadoni himself recorded in 1968,
                  “is far from being homogeneous”. Indeed, the analysis of the unearthed structures, briefly sketched in the final report, and
                  then refined by the study of Giuseppe Fanfoni (<em>Sonqi Tino I</em>) has allowed the identification of multiple building phases in the
                  life of the church, including an earlier one, during which it had a basilica plan, and various later renovations.

                <br>
                <p>
                  The major enterprise, and the greatest result, of <em>Sapienza</em>’s work at Sonqi was the identification and recovery of the mural paintings decorating the church. Indeed, as Donadoni commented on the 1968 report,
                  <blockquote>what gave this little church a peculiar character was its lavish pictorial decoration.</blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The distribution of the paintings seems to have mainly affected the rooms that composed the cruciform layout
                  (rooms 2, 4, 5, 6, 8), and in part also the two <em>pastophoria</em> (room 1, 3). The iconographic programme included
                  representations divine/royal figures (the Pantokrator from the <em>haikal</em>; Christ protecting king Georgios from room 8)
                  and icons (the Holy Trinity on the eastern pillar between room 5 and 6) as well as of Biblical episodes
                  (the Nativity from room 4; the Three Hebrews in the furnace from room 6). All these themes,
                  well-attested within the framework of Nubian Christianity, find analogies with the painted decoration
                  from other churches, like Faras, Abd el-Gadir, Tamit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their dating can be fixed with confidence to the second half of the tenth century, as it is confirmed by the inscription
                  accompanying the group of Christ protecting a king in room 8, which mentions “Georgios the son of Zacharias”.
                  The identification of the king with Georgios II (r. before 969) indicates, in both cases, that the composition of
                  pictorial cycle coincided with the main architectural phase of the church.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Together with the paintings, the exploration of the monument also recorded a number of inscriptions on the walls
                  of the church. Painted or scratched on the plaster, the corpus included texts of different length and content
                  (from the simple mention of names and titles to longer official inscriptions by prominent figures), written in
                  both Greek and Old Nubian, thus illustrating the frequentation of the site and the multilinguism of contemporary society.

                <br>
                <p>
                  Since the first season of excavations, it appeared that the preservation of the mural paintings inside the church
                  was at risk, having suffered from the partial collapse of the masonry and from the roots of the vegetation growing in the area.
                  Their recovery and restoration, therefore, was a top priority. The activities of detachment and consolidation of the wall paintings
                  were carried out by the famous Italian restorer Leonetto Tintori, with the collaboration of Silvestro Castellani.
                  The operations were as difficult as delicate, given the harsh environment, and their transportation raised no less problems,
                  since they had to travel along desert trails before reaching the train-station at Wadi Halfa and being shipped to Italy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally arrived in Florence, the paintings were restored in the laboratories at the Uffizi by Tintori himself,
                  who consolidated them and applied light supports. In a letter to Giovanni Vantini (January 20th 1968), Donadoni described the result as follows:
                  <blockquote>
                    As for the restoration, it seems to me that a greater care for the original
                    conditions could not have been attained. The type of painting, its original quality,
                    the very damages suffered <em>ab antiquo</em>, the graffiti, the inscriptions – everything is (to me) perfect.
                  </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                  After completing the work, and before returning them to the Sudanese authorities, it was decided to display the restored paintings
                  in an official exhibition that took place from 9 to 15 February 1968 at the Aula Magna of the Italian C.N.R. in Rome.
                  In reporting the event in a letter to the then head of the <em>Istituto Italiano di Cultura in Cairo</em>, Carla Burri, Donadoni gracefully
                  commented that it was a success both for the material presented and the arrangement
                </p>
                  <blockquote>
                  thanks to Tintori, in the first place, but also to Fanfoni and Montalto, who did their best and succeeded in changing a Mussolinian hall,
                  with genii à foison on the walls in a room where one cannot but admire what has to be seen
                  <br>February 10th 1968).
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The exhibition had a large resonance on both Italian and international media (Figure giornali),
                  but was especially a unique chance for scholars – in the words of Donadoni –
                </p>
                  <blockquote>
                  to have a direct glimpse of this material which, beside that from Faras (Sudan) held at Warsaw, is rarely appreciable in European Museum.
                  </blockquote>
                <p>
                  As a result of all the efforts, the Sudanese authorities donate half of the recovered paintings to Italy, namely eighteen to <em>Sapienza</em> University,
                  being displayed in what is today the <em>Museum of Near East, Egypt and the Mediterranean</em>, and one to the <em>Vatican Museums</em>. The remaining half (18)
                  stayed in Sudan, where it entered the collection of the <em>Sudan National Museum</em> of Khartoum.

                <p>
                  After almost fifty years from the discovery of the church of Sonqi Tino and from the first exhibition of its decoration,
                  on 21 February 2012, <em>Sapienza</em> and C.N.R. organised, under the coordination of Loredana Sist, a new event –
                  <em>The Nubian Church of Soni Tino: a multidisciplinary approach</em> – that aimed to reassess the situation of the paintings and
                  their context in the light of a detailed programme of screening, analysis, and restoration. The conference was the occasion
                  to present the results of the project as well as some updating and refinement on various issues, from chronology,
                  to material culture, to landscape. Above all, the event has demonstrated, on the basis of the specific Nubian case,
                  the tremendous gain that historical inquiry can obtain from the collaboration of different expertise, combining the
                  archaeological perspective with a detailed archival research and the potentialities of modern diagnostic technologies.
